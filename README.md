## Overview
<div align=center><img src="pngs/overview.png"></div>

In this paper, we propose Multi-variate Probit based Variational AutoEncoder (MPVAE) to 1) align the label embedding subspace and the feature embedding subspace and 2) handle the correlations between labels via classic Multi-variate Probit model. MPVAE improves both the **embedding space learning** and **label correlation encoding**. Furthermore, Î²-VAE brings disentanglement effects and could improve the performance compared to vanilla VAE.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 1.15.0
- numpy 1.17.3
- sklearn 0.22.1

Older versions might work as well.

A PyTorch implementation of MPVAE can be found [here](https://github.com/wenting-zhao/mpvae).

## Usage

### Download this Repository
```git clone``` this repo to your local machine.

### Obtain and Process the Data
All datasets can be downloaded from the ~~Google [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TA2tOxXIr1wp0KWcPKICxYMFclJR_6od?usp=sharing)~~ Baidu [drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yfah4vjh1NZjHxDwAcfqSg?pwd=qxx4).

The downloaded datasets are already in the format that can be recognized by the code. 

### Data Format
The downloaded datasets are organized in the `npy` format. There are 4 `npy` files in total. One contains the data entries and the others are indices for train, validation and test splits. For example, mirflickr dataset has 4 `npy` files: `mirflickr_data.npy`, `mirflickr_train_idx.npy`, `mirflickr_val_idx.npy`, `mirflickr_test_idx.npy`.

<div align=center><img src="pngs/data_format.png"></div>
The data format is very simple and one can construct his/her own datasets. For each data point in `xxx_data.npy`, the first `meta_offset` (default 0) dims contains some meta information (e.g. index, description, etc.), which will not be considered as part of the features. The following `label_dim` entries indicate the 0/1 labels for this data point. The last `feat_dim` entries are the features used for training.

The other 3 `npy` files are just the lists of indices for different splits.

### Train and Test MPVAE

We use mirflickr as the running example here. The detailed descriptions of FLAGS can be found in `config.py`.

To train the model, use the following script:
```bash
./run_train_mirflickr.sh
```
The best validation checkpoint will be written into `run_test_mirflickr.sh` automatically, if one sets the flag `write_to_test_sh` to `True` and specifies the path to the test bash with flag `test_sh_path`.

To test the model, use the following script:
```bash
./run_test_mirflickr.sh
```
The default hyper-parameters should give reasonably good results.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.

### Hyperparameters for More Datasets

One can further check the scripts under `scripts` folder, which contains tuned hyperparameters for most datasets.
